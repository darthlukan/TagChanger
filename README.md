## Description

> TagChanger v0.1 for Craftbukkit 1.7+

> This plugin allows players to change their display names
in the TAB (player) list on servers running Craftbukkit 1.7+.

## Usage

```
    /changetag =D
```

> Then press TAB to show the player list.  For example, if the player's name is
"Player1", then the result in the player list would be:

```
    Player1: =D
```

## Important!

> This plugin is limited in what it can do, the character limit for the TAB list
> is 16 characters, so for now, this plugin is only "useful" if you plan on
> using simple emoticon symbols such as the one in the usage example.
